The mortgage contract entered into with us will be secured by a mortgage on the property. The Society undertakes a thorough affordability assessment to ensure responsible lending. The amount you can borrow is calculated using a combination of your income, regular financial commitments, household/lifestyle expenditure, and the required term at an agreed stressed rate. This ensures affordability extends beyond the initial product rate. All unsecured loans/HPI agreements with more than 6 months remaining, credit cards, and maintenance costs are deducted when assessing affordability. Deductions are also made for declared household and lifestyle expenditure, which is compared against statistical data for accuracy. We request accurate details of your income and expenditure for a precise calculation and recommend using our affordability calculator before starting a Decision in Principle. Please check our frequently asked questions section if you have any questions regarding the use of the calculator.

We understand that affordability can be a key challenge, so we offer a range of products to help. Our Affordability Boost range offers a better affordability assessment for fixed-rate mortgages longer than five years, potentially allowing you to borrow more, depending on your financial situation. This is available for those selecting a product term of more than 5 years but is not available for all lending types and cannot be combined with other products like Interest Only, Large Loans, Shared Ownership, or Government First Homes.

The minimum age for applicants is 18, and the maximum age for borrowers at the end of the loan term is 80.

For Armed Forces Personnel, all applicants must have at least two years left to serve. If the applicant will also live in accommodation provided by the M.O.D., they must be able to support both the new mortgage and associated living costs, which must be factored into the affordability assessment. If the applicant lives in M.O.D. accommodation full-time, the purchased property must be occupied by a spouse/partner. Sole applicants purchasing a property must occupy it full-time and be able to commute to their place of work daily unless on overseas tour. A 3-year residency history is required, and BFPO addresses are acceptable. We accept applications where the source of deposit is from the government-supported Forces Help to Buy scheme, subject to providing the Personal Information Note from the Ministry of Defence and including the monthly payment and insurance premium as a monthly commitment in the affordability assessment.

We can accept cases where Bankruptcy, Sequestration, IVA, or DRO have been discharged for over 3 years; anything less will be declined.

For British nationals working abroad, we expect the borrower's main residence to be currently within the UK, and they will reside in the property while in the UK. We do not accept 'ex-pat' scenarios where the applicant wishes to purchase a property in the UK and return at a later date. We only consider applications where the applicant's spouse/partner or immediate family will be a permanent resident, and the property must not be left unoccupied for more than 30 days a year. If the applicant pays for accommodation while working abroad, this must be disclosed and deducted within the affordability assessment. Salary should be paid into a UK bank account in UK sterling. The employer must be generally 'Blue Chip' for both UK and International companies. The maximum LTV for British nationals working abroad is 80%.

For applicants who already own one or more investment mortgages, we will consider up to 80% LTV, provided we receive evidence of satisfactory mortgage conduct with no missed payments (credit bureau data is acceptable). If rental income is required for affordability, it's input as income, and the mortgage payment is a commitment. If rental income is not required, it must cover the current mortgage payment by at least 145%; any shortfall is added as a commitment. For significant investment portfolios (greater than 5), we expect to see their Buy to Let (BTL) portfolio summary. Please see 'Let to Buy' for those looking to rent out their existing property and purchase a new home. Our full Buy to Let lending policy is available here.

Contract workers are considered higher risk due to affordability concerns after a contract ends. We require a track record of employment in the same sector for at least two years with no more than a 6-week break between contracts, evidenced by the last two P60s / SA302s and TYO or accounts. Applicants with fixed-term contracts in professional occupations like Doctors, Teachers, and Solicitors are regarded as permanently employed. Other contract workers are considered on their individual merits. Day Rate Contractors need to provide current and previous contracts covering the last 12 months, with 12 months' experience, and the current contract must have at least 1 month remaining or evidence of a new/extended contract. Contracts quoting a daily/weekly rate should be based on a 46-week period. A 1-month bank statement is required. For those paid via an Umbrella Company/IR35 or Self Employed, specific requirements apply to income calculation and documentation. Fixed Term Contract/Recruitment Agency/Zero Hour Contracts/Nurse Bank Staff require a 2-year track record in the chosen industry, evidenced by P60s or Tax Calculations and overviews. CIS Workers need 2 years' proof of income via SA302s and supporting documents. Early Career Teachers (ECT) can only be considered in their second year, and Junior Doctors in Foundation Year 1 are not acceptable.

As part of our assessment, we credit score all mortgage applications. Applicants are scored at the Decision in Principle stage, a soft search that doesn't leave a footprint on their credit file. The score will either accept, decline, or refer applications to our lead underwriters.

For Custom Build mortgages, we offer them exclusively via BuildStore Mortgage Services. We consider lending up to £1,000,000, depending on the LTV at the end of the build and loan to costs during the build. Funds are released on a stage payments basis. Contact BuildStore for details.

Active debt management will result in a declined application. Settled debt management shown on the credit report less than 12 months ago will also result in a decline.

The Society will use credit scoring to determine whether to proceed. Applications will normally be declined in circumstances of current secured arrears, unsecured arrears, unsatisfied CCJs or Defaults, secured/unsecured CCJs/defaults satisfied within the last 3 years, insolvency satisfied within the last 3 years, previous/current property repossession, active debt management, or debt collection payments. Underwriters may accept a maximum of 2 satisfied defaults/CCJs below £250 from utility companies, communications, or mail order within the last 3 years with a satisfactory explanation.

We may require the employment contract if an applicant has been employed for less than 6 months. Details of employment history for the past 12 months are required if the applicant has been with their current employer for less than 6 months or is in a probationary period.

For family purchases at a discounted price, we can consider lending 100% of the purchase price subject to valuation. Additional borrowing is only for home improvements. The acting solicitor must arrange defective title indemnity insurance. The current occupant must move out, and the property must be vacant on completion. The maximum loan is £500,000.

We no longer accept mortgage applications where a salary paid in a currency other than UK sterling is used for affordability. We also do not accept other non-UK sterling income sources. For interest-only loans, we will not accept a repayment strategy based on assets held outside the UK.

For EEA Nationals, EU/EEA/Swiss citizens (excluding the Republic of Ireland) must have settled status, unless another party on the mortgage is a UK citizen or has settled status, in which case pre-settled status is acceptable up to 95% LTV. Joint applications with both parties having pre-settled status are accepted up to 80% LTV. Applicants must have lived in the UK for at least 2 years and provide proof of their status. For Non-EEA Nationals, they can borrow up to 80%, with referrals above this considered. They must have lived in the UK for at least 2 years, have indefinite leave to remain, or have at least 3 months remaining on a Skilled Worker or Health and Care Worker visa. Family (spousal) visa applications are acceptable under specific terms.
